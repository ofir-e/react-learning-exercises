# react-learning-exercises

react must have interactive hands on learning exercises

To start practicing use degit cli with this template.

```sh
npx degit git-repo-of-this-template-here my-exercise
cd my-exercise
npm i
npm start
```

and thats it!

the exercise will open in localhost:3000

you can even debug your ts react code thru vscode using f5 (after npm start)
which will open it in chrome and will be debugged in your vscode

the exercises are located in exercises folder.

each exercise have a single file named ex(number here).tsx that you need to fix.

in each file you have instructions on what you are allowed to change.

good luck!
